# Tukey

A high-performance static analysis tool that maps code dependencies, highlights complexity, and uncovers dead code across
large projects. Designed to be **language-agnostic**, the engine can analyze code architecture and usage patterns in any
language.

The initial release focuses on **PHP support**, with additional languages planned for the future.

## Features

- 🔍 Deep Code Analysis — Parses source files to extract structural elements (classes, functions, methods, properties)
- 🕸️ Dependency Mapping — Builds comprehensive graphs showing code relationships
- 📊 Complexity Metrics — Identifies areas of high complexity
- 🎯 Usage Tracking — Finds where functions and classes are used across the project
- 👻 Dead Code Detection — Flags unused or orphaned code
- ⚡ High Performance — Concurrent processing for fast analysis of large projects

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boone-studios/tukey.git
cd tukey
make install
```

### Using Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/boone-studios/tukey/cmd/tukey@latest
```

### Download Binary

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/boone-studios/tukey/releases).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Basic analysis
tukey /path/to/your/php/project

# Verbose output with function usage report
tukey -v /path/to/your/php/project

# Export results to JSON
tukey -v --output analysis.json /path/to/your/php/project

# Exclude directories
tukey --exclude vendor --exclude tests /path/to/your/php/project
```

## Use Cases

### Legacy Code Understanding
Perfect for analyzing inherited PHP codebases with little documentation:

```bash
tukey -v ./legacy-project
```

**Output shows:**
- Most critical classes (highly depended upon)
- Dead code candidates (orphaned functions)
- Complex areas needing refactoring
- Helper function usage patterns

### Function Usage Tracking
Find where specific functions like `format_phone()` are used:

```bash
📋 FUNCTION USAGE REPORT
======================================================================
📁 app/Lib/helpers.php
  📋 function format_phone() (line 15) - 8 calls
  🔗 Called from 8 locations:
    📂 app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php:
      → line 45 in store()
      → line 78 in update()
```

### Refactoring Planning
Identify refactoring opportunities:
- **God Classes** - High complexity scores
- **Tight Coupling** - Classes with many dependencies
- **Circular Dependencies** - Problematic architectural patterns

## Output Examples

### Console Summary
```
📊 Graph Statistics:
   • Total Nodes: 1,284
   • Total Dependencies: 2,891
   • Orphaned Elements: 23

🔥 Most Depended Upon Elements:
   1. Database (helpers/Database.php) - 47 dependents
   2. Utils (lib/Utils.php) - 34 dependents

🧠 Most Complex Elements:
   1. OrderController (Http/Controllers/OrderController.php) - Score: 89
   2. UserService (Services/UserService.php) - Score: 67
```

### JSON Export
```json
{
  "nodes": {
    "class:App\\Models\\User:8": {
      "id": "class:App\\Models\\User:8",
      "name": "User",
      "type": "class",
      "file": "/app/Models/User.php",
      "dependencies": {...},
      "dependents": {...}
    }
  },
  "totalNodes": 1284,
  "totalEdges": 2891
}
```

## Architecture

The tool follows clean architecture principles:

- **`cmd/`** - Application entry points
- **`internal/`** - Private application code
- **`pkg/`** - Public library code
- **`testdata/`** - Test fixtures
- **`docs/`** - Documentation

## Configuration

Create a `configs/analyzer.yaml` file:

```yaml
exclude_dirs:
  - vendor
  - node_modules
  - storage/cache
  - .git

include_extensions:
  - .php
  - .phtml

max_concurrent_parsers: 10
```

## Contributing

2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Development
